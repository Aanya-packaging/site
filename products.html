        <h2 class="subtitle">INTRODUCTION</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">Corrugated Kraft Paper Board Box, technically called Corrugated Fiber Board Box is the
            most popular shipping container, now-a-days. The box is manufactured from corrugated
            board which consists of 3 or more layers of Kraft paper. The middle fluted layer is pasted
            with two flat parallel sheets of paper. The boxes find their number of applications in the
            packaging of chemicals & drugs, tobacco, engineering goods, canned & bottled goods, food
            products, lamps, electrical appliances, glass wares etc. Packaging plays a very important
            role in the country's economy. Till recently only the western world, more particularly the
            developed countries cared about proper packaging. However, now even developing
            countries like India have changed their outlook towards packaging and in the last few years
            increasing stress has been laid on improved and proper packaging. In fact, today, packaging
            is as important as the contents.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">CORRUGATED BOARD</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Corrugated fiber board consists of a flat layer of paper sheet (liner) glued on one or both
            sides of a corrugated paper (medium). The corrugated board is made by passing two
            layers of paper (usually Kraft) through corrugating machine. One layer of paper
            becomes corrugated after being passed through the heated rolls and other is brought
            into contact with it after the former having glued at tips. The corrugating 'medium' is
            generally made from a 0.009" thick (9 caliper) or 0.23 mm. The glue frequently used is
            starch or silicate of soda adhesive. When only one liner is used, the product is known as
            "Single face" or "two ply" board. This board is flexible in one direction. When the
            corrugated medium is combined on both sides with flat sheets, it is known as double
            faced or "3-ply board".</p>


            <h2 class="subtitle">ADVANTAGES OF CORRUGA AGES OF CORRUGATED FIBER BOARD BOXES:-</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Corrugated fiberboard boxes have replaced the wooden and tin containers due to their
            several advantages for safe transportation of the goods. These are discussed here
            under:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Light in weight (freight advantage)
                </li>
                <li>Cellular structure with high compressive strength, resiliency & shock resistance.
                    Assured safety to delicate articles.
                    </li>
                <li>Can be stored conveniently in folded condition when not in use, thus saving storage
                    space.</li>
                <li>Can be attractively printed, thus advertising advantage.</li>
                <li>By lining, lamination or coating, they can be made water resistant and resistant to
                    other adverse conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subtitle">APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Corrugated fiber board boxes are being used for the packing of industrial as well as
                consumer goods. They are used for packing of chemicals, drugs, tobacco, engineering
                goods, canned and bottled goods (such as Whisky, Beer, Soda, Drinking Water, Ketchups
                etc.), food, electrical appliances, confectionary, textiles, fruits, vegetables, potteries,
                footwear, glass wares and other fragile items, medical instruments, photographic
                equipments and a number of other products.</p>
